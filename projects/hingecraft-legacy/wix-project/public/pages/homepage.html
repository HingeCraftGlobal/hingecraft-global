      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Welcome to HingeCraft Global</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        We are living in a time of extraordinary possibility — and extraordinary peril. New technologies, global trade, and human ingenuity have given us the ability to make more, cure more, and connect more than any generation before us. At the same time, those same forces have made our systems fragile: a single shortage, a single market shock, a single failure of governance can ripple outward and break the things we depend on — our jobs, our neighborhoods, our health systems, and the natural world that sustains us all.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        This is not an abstract problem. It is the daily reality of millions: a parent whose factory closed, a small shop that could not survive a shipment delay, a community whose hospital had to postpone care because a critical part could not be delivered. It is why, if we do not act together now, the future we imagine for our children becomes far harder to build.

    <section class="prose max-w-none mb-16 bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Our Mission</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        The purpose of the Charter for Abundance & Resilience is a simple, urgent idea: we can and must design our institutions, our money, and the places we make and live so that abundance does not remain fragile. We can build systems that produce more and protect everyone from cascading collapse.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        But to make this charter real — to bring it from a draft into the halls of the United Nations and into the hands of governments and investors — we need a very particular thing that only you and millions of others can provide: <strong>your voice</strong>.
      </p>

    <!-- How It Works Section -->
    <section class="prose max-w-none mb-16">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">How You Can Help</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        We invite you to join a global pledge — a simple act of solidarity — that will be bundled with our formal submission of the Charter to the United Nations. Your pledge will do three powerful things:
      </p>
      <ol class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Amplify Your Voice:</strong> Your pledge becomes part of a global movement that speaks directly to world leaders and decision-makers.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape Policy:</strong> Millions of voices together can influence the creation of policies that protect communities and build resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Change:</strong> Your participation helps transform ideas into action, ensuring that abundance benefits everyone, not just a few.</li>
      </ol>

    <!-- About Section -->
    <section class="prose max-w-none mb-16">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">About the Charter</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        The Charter for Abundance & Resilience is a comprehensive framework designed to protect towns as well as markets, reward investors who verify public benefit, guarantee retraining and dignity for displaced workers, and bind global technology to human oversight.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        Our movement is not about ideology. It is about a common sense of obligation: to protect the conditions that make human life possible — clean air and water, safe food, meaningful work, and a chance for our children to thrive. It is a pledge to transform fear into agency and complexity into action.
