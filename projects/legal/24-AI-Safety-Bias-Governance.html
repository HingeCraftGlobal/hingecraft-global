    <h3>2.5 Accountability</h3>
    <p>AI systems must: (a) Have clear ownership and responsibility; (b) Include mechanisms for redress; (c) Be subject to regular review and audit; (d) Allow for human oversight and override.</p>

    <h2>3. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE</h2>
    
    <h3>3.1 AI Ethics Committee</h3>
    <p>An AI Ethics Committee oversees AI governance: (a) Reviews high-risk AI applications; (b) Develops and updates AI policies; (c) Investigates AI-related concerns; (d) Reports to executive management.</p>
    
    <h3>3.2 AI Product Owners</h3>
    <p>Each AI system has a designated owner responsible for: (a) Compliance with this Policy; (b) Risk assessment and mitigation; (c) Monitoring and maintenance; (d) Incident response.</p>
    
    <h3>3.3 Data Science Team</h3>
    <p>The Data Science Team is responsible for: (a) Technical implementation of safeguards; (b) Bias testing and mitigation; (c) Model documentation; (d) Technical review of AI systems.</p>

    <h2>4. RISK ASSESSMENT</h2>
    
    <h3>4.1 Risk Categories</h3>
    <p>AI applications are categorized by risk level:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Risk:</strong> Systems affecting health, safety, legal rights, or significant financial decisions;</li>
        <li><strong>Medium Risk:</strong> Systems with moderate impact on individuals;</li>
        <li><strong>Low Risk:</strong> Systems with minimal individual impact (e.g., product recommendations).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4.2 Assessment Process</h3>
    <p>Before deployment, AI systems undergo: (a) Purpose and scope documentation; (b) Data quality assessment; (c) Bias evaluation; (d) Safety and security review; (e) Privacy impact assessment; (f) Ethics review (for high-risk systems).</p>

    <h2>5. BIAS PREVENTION AND MITIGATION</h2>
    
    <h3>5.1 Data Quality</h3>
