## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review Task Breakdown**
   - Open `agents/TASKS_BREAKDOWN.md` to review all tasks
   - Prioritize critical and high-priority tasks

2. **Execute Tasks Systematically**
   - Start with critical security tasks
   - Then high-priority file verification
   - Then integration tests
   - Finally, medium-priority optimization tasks

3. **Track Progress**
   - Use task IDs (TASK_000001 to TASK_005171) to track completion
   - Update status as tasks are completed
   - Generate progress reports

4. **Automate Execution**
   - Use `agents/NANO_TASKS_COMPLETE.json` for automated task execution
   - Create scripts to check task status
   - Generate completion reports
